One day Jerry was surfing on the internet when all of a sudden he gets an email from what he thought was the government. The email stated that if he didnt pay a new civilization fee of $500 he wouldn't be considered a US citizen. Worried about not being a citizen, Jerry clicked the link attached to the email and put in all of his personal info that the website asked for. After he sent the money and his info he was later hacked and his identity was stolen.
